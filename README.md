# Plate of Nations Redesign

## Project Status 
This project was a student-driven Capstone at the University of Washington's Information School in Winter/Spring 2023. Starting June 1st 2023, it will transition to open source for future iSchool Capstone teams to develop (with no plans for maintenance by the original team).

## What is Plate of Nations?
Plate of Nations is an electrifying annual event that was crafted by the MLK Business Association. It serves as a platform to promote the eclectic mix of independently-owned restaurants nestled in the vibrant MLK community. This two-week long festival is a celebration of culture and diversity as it showcases the mouthwatering delights of immigrant-owned businesses in the Rainier Valley neighborhood of Seattle, Washington. It's an incredible opportunity for food lovers to tantalize their taste buds with the delectable flavors of traditional dishes from around the world.

## Our Mission
Our team embarked on a mission to elevate the online presence of Plate of Nations by breathing new life into its website design. The goal was to create an unforgettable user experience that would immerse attendees in the cultural richness of the participating restaurants. We put usability and accessibility at the forefront of our design process, embracing a mobile-first approach that delivers a seamless and engaging browsing experience. The redesigned website now features detailed event information, a searchable restaurant directory, and a Digital Plate of Nations Passport.
