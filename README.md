## Project Status 
This project was a student-driven Capstone at the University of Washington's Information School in Winter/Spring 2023. **Starting June 1st 2023, it will transition to open source** for future iSchool Capstone teams to develop (with no plans for maintenance by the original team).

## What is Plate of Nations?
Plate of Nations is an electrifying annual event that was crafted by the MLK Business Association. It serves as a platform to promote the eclectic mix of independently-owned restaurants nestled in the vibrant MLK community. This two-week long festival is a celebration of culture and diversity as it showcases the mouthwatering delights of immigrant-owned businesses in the Rainier Valley neighborhood of Seattle, Washington. It's an incredible opportunity for food lovers to tantalize their taste buds with the delectable flavors of traditional dishes from around the world.


## Our Mission
Our team embarked on a mission to elevate the online presence of Plate of Nations by breathing new life into its website design. The goal was to create an unforgettable user experience that would immerse attendees in the cultural richness of the participating restaurants. We put usability and accessibility at the forefront of our design process, embracing a mobile-first approach that delivers a seamless and engaging browsing experience. The redesigned website now features detailed event information, a searchable restaurant directory, and a Digital Plate of Nations Passport.

# Important Team Decisions 
### 1. Color Scheme 
After meeting with stakeholders, we decided to strictly use only the Plate of Nations brand colors -- reds, oranges, yellows, beige, and black. There may be some other colors used as accent, but the website will primary be in these colors 

Reason 
  - Too many colors --> considered distracting
  - Keep the Plate of Nations branding and theme consistent 
  
### 2. Build with Github instead of Website Builders 
While our team explored possible website builders that could be used to create this website, we decided to code it manually with Github instead. 

Reason
  - Our group was unable to afford the annual fees. Too many features had to be "unlocked" with an expensive subscription to implement our solution. 
  - We do not have access to PoN's current website (we realize this might be a liability and security concern for them so we decided not to ask)
  - Github is a collaborative, low cost platform -- there are little to no fees associated with creating an account, maintaining a repo, and collaborating with several users. 
 
Here is also the [list of pros & cons](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yzZQ-iDiZ7f2eqVa7-5d8QOM77jcMBVTjp-Ihj2ncOA/edit?usp=sharing ) we created to assess how suitable each website builder would be for implementation.
  
### 3. Our design did not go through an extensive fifth iteration 
During our last round of usability testing, we received feedback on how the current iteration might be considered "cookie-cutter" and there were suggestions to implement a more creative, unique experience. Here is a list of pros & cons we created analyzing popular website builders

Reason
  - Due to limited time and upcoming capstone deadlines, we decided to prioritize implementing our current design. If given more time, we would definitely explore other alternative deisgns that might be more engaging and exciting.
